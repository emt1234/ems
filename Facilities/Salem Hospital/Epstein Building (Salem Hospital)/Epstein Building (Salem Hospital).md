The **Epstein Building** contains all of [[Salem Hospital]]'s in-patient psychiatric units.

## Access
The Epstein building has it's own entrance, located to the left of the ambulance bay for the emergency department.

Additionally, a skybridge on the second floor of Epstein connects the building to the rest of the campus.

### IFT Access
Park in the ambulance bay, preferably in the spots across from the building. Take the paved path around the side of the building to the Epstein entrance, press the doorbell for security to gain access.

Continue down the hallway to the Epstein elevator, and take the elevator to the desired floor. Note that some floors require using the rear door.
